LCD Version one complete by Tom on 08/03/20

contents of LCD version 1
- Code to send received chartacters to the LCD 
- Code to decrypt the input character to the relative ASCII character
To do in version 2
- Check busy flag
- Code to initiate 8 bit LCD

Noah checked this on 11/03/2020
The VHDL needs more commenting, it's best to have a step by step explanation of the process. 
The output from the buffer is an 8 bit logic vector so we need to consider how you take this as an input.
We need an error state for when things go wrong.


Version two complete by Tom on 25/03/20
Contents of LCD version 2
-Check busy flag added
-Initiation code added
-problems ran into when portmapping Busy flag and chacracter choice
-Busyflag and character choice code dubugged so problem is with the portmapping
to be done in version 3
-move all code to seperate VHDL files
-Portmap all code to aid in debugging.

Looks very tidy and easy to understand. Having the code in seperate files helps a lot.


Version three complete by Tom and Oscar on 14/04/20
Content of LCD verstion 3
-  Everything moved to main LCD File to fix portmapping issue
-  Changed character choice code
to be done in version 4
-  Comment code more thoroughly
-  change to a state machine format to make initialisation trigger

We had a group call, Tom shared his code and Oscar checked it too. 
Any new changes that we made should be commented thoroughly, noting what
was Oscar's input too.


Version four complete by Tom on 18/04/20
Content of LCD verstion 4
-  changed to state machine format
-  initialisation now works
to be done in version 5

Looks good but I agree with suggestions for version 5. 
Very close to finishing now.


Version five complete by Tom on 21/04/20
Content of LCD verstion 5
-  Enable triggers for 10 us 
-  3 ms delay in place of the wait busy like instructed
-  all signals trigger at expected times
-  state machine format works perfectly
to be done in version 6
-  Comment code more thoroughly

Still needs to be commmented. May be worth going on call, sharing code
and running us through it step by step to know where commenting is needed.
You also need to make sure that your indentation is correct throughout. 
Label the signals and variables so that anyone can understand what they do.

Content of LCD verstion 6
-  Enable triggers for 10 us 
-  3 ms delay in place of the wait busy like instructed
